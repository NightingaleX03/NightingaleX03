### (Favorite inspiratonal Quote:) :star2:
> ‚ÄúCoding, it's an endless process of trial and error, of trying to get the right command in the right place, with sometimes just a semicolon making the difference between success and failure. Code breaks and then it falls apart, and it often takes many, many tries until that magical moment when what you're trying to build comes to life.‚Äù - Reshma Saujani

Althought I have many interests I'm still finding an area in cs which suits me and interests me as a career :D <br>
I hope using github I'll be able to have fun with coding, make new connections, and learn more about my interests! <br>
